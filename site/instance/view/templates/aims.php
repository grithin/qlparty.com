	<h3>Preface</h3>
	<main>
	The one primary aim of the Quality of Life Party is to improve, in a continued, intergenerational manner, the quality of life for the majority of people in the society.  With this aim, the party takes stances on various issues.  Generally, the Quality of Life Party does not take a stance without a strong foundation linking the stance to an improved quality of life.

	<h3>Issues</h3>
	<main>
		<section>
			<h4>War</h4>
			<main>
				<ul>
					<li>Against US military force used in any peaceful country that has not committed a publicly proven act of war against the United States</li>
					<li>Against large military bases; these bases are not needed by a peaceful country</li>
					<li>Against funding, training, or providing shelter to terrorists</li>
					<li>Against the use of depleted uranium rounds</li>
					<li>For repurposing war factories and war engineers towards civil purposes</li>
					
				</ul>
				<div class="reasoning">
					There are a very few who benefit from war, and a great many who suffer.  Generally, oligarchs, in whatever form, are the sole beneficiaries.  For some preliminary, though biased, insight on the matter, you can watch this video: 
					<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5hfEBupAeo4">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5hfEBupAeo4</a>
					<p>The use of depleted uranium ammunition has caused various health problems for those involved in its use or near its use.  This type of round should be removed from the arsenal.</p>
					<p>The military industrial complex represents a vast amount of skills and tools.  Adandoning these skills and tools would be a loss to society.  Instead, they should be repurposed to help society.</p>

			<h4>Honesty</h4>
			<main>
				<ul>
					<li>For - in all cases</li>
				</ul>
				<div class="reasoning">
					<p>
						Where a personal or state secret needs to be kept, simply say nothing.  Lyring produces irrationality, which tends to produce lower quality of life.
					</p>
					<p>
						"In general, in regards to laws, judgments, or decisions made by officials, there is, for the most part, only one rare case in which it might be better to keep the knowledge ... private. In the case of war or adversity where some information could be used by an enemy for the purpose of damaging the society. .... However, the ability to have secret information provides an avenue for the massing of power. The purpose of government programs can be made secret for the purpose of national security; vast resources can be redistributed for the purpose of national security. It is nearly always imperative that, if any secrets are kept in a society, those secrets are short lived and thoroughly scrutinized." - V3.0.0 Persistence Society.

			<h4 id="_a_environment">Environment</h4>
			<main>
				<ul>
					<li>For US produced energies</li>
					<li>For clean, renewable, and safe energies</li>
					<li>Against taxing CO<sub>2</sub></li>
					<li>For permaculture</li>
					<li>For promoting home gardens and local small scale farms</li>
					<li>For helping Japan deal with Fukishima</li>
				</ul>
				<div class="reasoning">
					<p>
					Shutting down clean coal plants in the US and then importing energy from dirty energy producing countries serves neither the US nor the planet.    It is in the interest of the party to promote both the increased production of energy in the US and the use of clean, renewable, and safe energies.  
					</p>
					<p>
					Carbon Dioxide is not a pollutant.  Special interests would like you to think otherwise.  People exhale carbon dioxide.  It is a product in the krebb cycle.  However, it is also necessary for plants to convert light in energy.  One of the reactants in photosynthesis is CO<sub>2</sub>, and one of the products is oxygen.  IE, plants use CO<sub>2</sub> and release oxygen.  
					See <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Photosynthesis#Overview">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Photosynthesis#Overview</a>
					So, if you want less CO<sub>2</sub>, plant more trees, don't harass smaller farmers about their livestock.
					</p>
					<p>Predictions presented by those arguing that human CO<sub>2</sub> production has led to global warming have, without fail, been wrong.  The subject has been fraught with controversy and propaganda.  So, until the data shows human produced CO<sub>2</sub> presents a danger, the party is against regulating its production. </p>
					
					<p>The Fukishima disaster presents the case for the US to involve itself in the solution to the problem.  The seepage of nuclear waste in to the ocean presents a current and future threat to the quality of life of those around the world.</p>
					<p>The government has a role in preventing dessertification and the depletion of soil.  Permaculture and sustainable farming should be encouraged.</p>

			<h4>Energy</h4>
			<main>
				<ul>
					<li>For US produced energies</li>
					<li>For clean, reneable, and safe energies</li>
				</ul>
				<div class="reasoning">
					See <a href="#_a_environment">Environemnt</a>.  The US nuclear energy is in a sad state of affairs in which the country is relying on unsafe nuclear plants built in the 70's or before.  Further reliance on nuclear energy must come with better designs, better safe-guards against catastrophe, better plans for dealing with the waste.

			<h4>Homeland Security</h4>
			<main>
				<ul>
					<li>Against paranoia</li>
					<li>Against intrusive, unsafe, and ineffective security measures</li>
				</ul>
			</main>
			<div class="reasoning">
				The effectiveness and safety of body scanners is doubted by many, and shown lacking by some.  The purpose of terrorism is not to kill, it is to draw attention and terrorize.  With this in mind, you'd think the US government and the media wanted the terrorists to win by focusing on the terror of terroristic events in the past.  If, indeed, there are real jihadi terrorists in the US, there are innumerable, unplugable ways to cause terror that these terrorists could use and that no amount of security could prevent.  As such, homeland security has served only to terrorize and criminalize the US citizen.

			<h4>Drugs</h4>
			<main>
				<ul>
					<li>For legalization of the use of various mostly non-harmful, currently illegal drugs (ex: marijuana)</li>
					<li>For maintaining harsh penalties on the distribution of destructive drugs like cocaine</li>
					<li>For defunding the war on drugs</li>
				</ul>
			</main>
			<div class="reasoning">
				<p>When a sick person is not capable of helping himself, he may become a drain on the resources of society.  It becomes an interest of society, then, to prevent that person from getting sick.  As such, society should promote healthy eating, healthy and safe activities, and should discourage unhealthy eating, unealthy and unsafe activities.  Drugs can be seen as making someone sick.  And so, in the interest of society, it becomes an interest of society to prevent the use of some types of drugs that will lead to a drain on society's resources.  However, not all sick people drain society's resources, and not all drugs make people sick.  To the contrary, many currently legal drugs are seen to improve the quality of life of those who use them.</p>
				<p>Unless it can be proven a drug poses a threat to society, that drug should not be disallowed for use.  The high level of imprisonment and fines for the use of drugs which have not been shown to hard society results in a diminished quality of life for those affected directly and indirectly.  However, the selling of drugs of a destructive nature is certainly criminal.</p>

			<h4>Welfare</h4>
			<main>
				<ul>
					<li>No position</li>
				</ul>
			</main>
			<div class="reasoning">
				The immediate quality of life improvement provided by welfare must be looked at in contrast to the dependency created by such welfare and the increase in taxes required to pay for that welfare.

		</section>
		
		<section>
			<h4>Gun Control</h4>
			<main>
				<ul>
					<li>Against disarming the citizenry</li>
					<li>For promoting understanding of proper use of firearms</li>
				</ul>
			</main>
			<div class="reasoning">
				You don't stop criminals by taking guns away from law abiding citizens - you encourage them.  There is no statistical basis for government to withdraw the right of citizens to own guns.

		<section>
			<h4>Health Care</h4>
			<main>
				<ul>
					<li>For health care in  principle</li>
					<li>Against the bloated, bureaucratic, inefficient, anti-human, pro-pharma health care currently being peddled</li>
					<li>Against increasing governments role in health care while government continues to: serve special interest; present costly inefficiencies; and implement stifling regulations</li>
				</ul>
			</main>
			<div class="reasoning">
				Big Pharma is in bed with the government on many levels.  Similarly, food producers hold sway over the FDA.  And, as a result, our government agencies not only fail to protect us from harmful foods and drugs, but also, in many cases, help big companies at the expense of the average citizen. 
				It is the interest of the Quality of Life Party to improve the quality of life of the citizenry; this means providing information on healthy habbits, and making available care to the injured or sick.  However, with the current level of inefficiency and subversion in the US government, there are no economies of scale to be realized in any current health care plan, and it appears the best solutions is to scale back government's involvement in an effort to remove the corruption and inefficiencies which survive as a result of government involvement.
			</div>

		<section>
			<h4>Taxes</h4>
			<main>
				<ul>
					<li>For reducing taxes</li>
					<li>For reducing complexity and length of tax codes</li>
					<li>For taxing wall steet transactions</li>
					<li>For removing corporate tax exemptions</li>
				</ul>
			</main>
			<div class="reasoning">
				There needs to be broad reconsideration of government programs in relation to how they affect the quality of life of the citizenry, and whether those programs should be discontinued.  You can pretty much throw away Homeland Security and do nothing but improve the quality of life of the average citizen.

			<h4>Education</h4>
			<main>
				<ul>
					<li>For reducing costs by increasing efficiency and effectiveness</li>
				</ul>
			</main>
			<div class="reasoning">
				The internet, as a medium for education, presents the opportunity to provide quality educational material to large numbers of people at a low expense.  The development and distribution of this material should be encouraged, and the certification of people based on this material should be encouraged.

			<h4>Economy</h4>
			<main>
				<ul>
					<li>For nationalizing the Federal Reserve</li>
				</ul>
			</main>
			<div class="reasoning">
				<p>
					It should be quite obvious, even with just knowing the last decade of US history with the Federal Reserve, that having banks regulate themselves does not yield good results for the average citizen.  So, the solution to this current state of affairs is to nationalize the Federal Reserve and use the money printing power of the ogranization for better uses than funding zombie banks.
